            <p>This is a webpage for a fictional animal shelter that I created with Chris Burge. The primary purpose of this project was to practice CSS styling concepts and tools such as classes, cascading, floats, the box model, and media queries.</p>

            <p>A silly webpage created with Joel Stockamp at the end of our first day as Epicodus students, this page was a way for us to practice some of the basic HTML concepts we had been learning.</p>

<!-- Decided to comment out the cookie recipe link for now so that I can practice panels with a nice even number of projects. I will add this back in later. -->
      <!-- <h3><a href="https://jpremmel.github.io/cookie-recipe/" target="_blank">Cookie Recipe Webpage</a></h3>
      <p>This is a webpage for a basic cookie recipe. While learning how to push and clone Git repositories, Joel Stockamp and I used this project to practice organizing HTML code with correct indentation and spacing.</p> -->

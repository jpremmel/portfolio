      <h3><a href="https://jpremmel.github.io/vacation/" target="_blank">Lake Tahoe Webpage</a></h3>
      <p>This is a webpage featuring information about a vacation destination - in this case, Lake Tahoe. Kira Roberts and I created fictional vacation packages in order to practice making a grid of panels with Bootstrap.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://jpremmel.github.io/Animal-Shelter/" target="_blank">Animal Shelter Webpage</a></h3>
      <p>This is a webpage for a fictional animal shelter that I created with Chris Burge. The primary purpose of this project was to practice CSS styling concepts and tools such as classes, cascading, floats, the box model, and media queries.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://jpremmel.github.io/island-resort/" target="_blank">Island Resort Webpage</a></h3>
      <p>This webpage features a fictional island resort. Neha Malhotra and I created this in order to practice basic HTML, CSS, and branching.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://jpremmel.github.io/test-website/" target="_blank">Test Webpage</a></h3>
      <p>A silly webpage created with Joel Stockamp at the end of our first day as Epicodus students, this page was a way for us to practice some of the basic HTML concepts we had been learning.</p>

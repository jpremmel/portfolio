      <h3><a href="https://jpremmel.github.io/Animal-Shelter/" target="_blank">Animal Shelter Webpage</a></h3>
      <p>This is a webpage for a fictional animal shelter. The primary purpose of this project was to practice CSS styling concepts and tools such as classes, cascading, floats, the box model, and media queries.</p>

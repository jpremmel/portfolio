        <p>Welcome to my programming portfolio! On this site you will find links to projects I have completed. So far, many of them were created as part of the curriculum at <span class="important">Epicodus</span>, where I am learning how to code.</p>
        <p>My interest in programming began during my junior year of college. I attended <span class="important">Willamette University</span> in <span class="important">Salem, Oregon</span>, where I double-majored in Physics and French. As part of my Physics major, I was required to take a programming course. I enjoyed the class a lot and I was surprised to find that I was pretty good at coding, so I took a second computer science course. In hindsight, I may have switched to a computer science major had I taken those courses earlier! But it was too late to change majors at that point, so I made a mental note to explore programming more in the future after graduating.</p>
        <p>For two years after college, I bounced around between career ideas: I contemplated grad school, medical school, and optometry school. I worked in optometry offices for a while before coming back to programming. I am originally from the <span class="important">California Bay Area</span>, so I'd grown up immersed in the <span class="important">Silicon Valley</span> tech scene. I'd worked a summer job at a startup company that had given me a taste of what working as a software developer could be like. Once I started researching coding schools, it became clear pretty quickly that <span class="important">Epicodus</span> would likely be a great next step...so here I am, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me next!</p>
        <p>I currently live in <span class="important">Portland, Oregon</span> with my partner and my dog, <span class="important">Sylvie</span>. I enjoy road cycling, jigsaw puzzles, baking, singing, and reading. Aside from becoming an all-star programmer, I hope to one day be an excellent piano player as well. Thanks for visiting my website!</p>
